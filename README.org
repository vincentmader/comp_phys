This repository contains a collection of numerical algorithms for modeling
various physics problems and visualizing them. As of yet, there is not much to
see.

Ideas for the future include:
  - classical mechanics
    + single pendulum
    + double pendulum
    + general n-pendulum
  - astronomy & gravity
    + n-body simulation
    + accreting binary star (fluid dyn. + gravity)
    + simulation of a multi-stage rocket
  - thermodynamics
    + ideal gas in a box
  - quantum mechanics
    + wavepacket-wavepacket scattering
    + Ising model
    + proton scattering with heavier ions (Glauber model)
  - fluid dynamics
    + flow through a pipe
    + flow through a rocket engine
  - maths
    + Lissajous curves
